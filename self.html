                        Creating a healthy, compassionate, self-understanding, and capable relationship to oneself and one's own emotions
            is critical to a life well-lived. Some of our focus areas include: Transforming depression, intrusive thinking, and sadness. Eliminating inner guilt & shame. Discovering and embracing one’s unique
            needs and values. Breaking through self-sabotage, and procrastination, and overcoming low- or high-level anxiety, for presence and peace-of-mind.

            The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates distilled what he believed to be the wisdom of all philosophy, simply: <i>Know Thyself.</i> 
            Coming to do so, and taking charge of what we discover, will be the keystone of the work we do together. 
                        <br><br> Put crudely and generally: Self-knowledge is the hard-won product of asking the very difficult question, 
                        "how am I responsible for co-creating the outcomes that I'm experiencing?" Or, "where am I getting in my own way?" 
                        <br> <br>I define the process of self-knowledge and self-mastery to include the cultivation of a mind that is able to deal 
                        effectively with anxiety; is capable of being present in the moment; is understanding and forgiving of its own idiosyncrasies 
                        and incapacities; is aware of its tendencies to do harm to itself and others; and is clear about the scope that 
                        remains for its evolution and growth.

                        A healthy and clarified relationship to self, I believe, is the keystone of a life well-lived. The concrete goals and outcomes of our work together can include healthier and more accurate self-concepts (e.g., what are my strengths and weaknesses, and where am I not treating myself with fairness?); ‘individuation’, or the state where one’s values, beliefs, and coping mechanisms are those that they have chosen consciously, as opposed to inherited unthinkingly; a more compassionate and productive internal monologue; and cognizance of one’s needs in the various spheres of one’s life.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe that this task is the keystone of the work we will be doing together. Abstractly, it begins with the realization that—often—the things that we believe are true about the world—including the stories that we tell ourselves about our flaws, failings, insecurities, and fears— are reflections not necessarily of the truth of the matter, but are reflections of our emotional histories. Concretely, in session, the work we will be going together can include:
                        <br><br>
                        i. Discovering and re-programming your core wounds, or the pervasive beliefs that exist across different areas of your life—consciously, or subconsciously. Common examples of such beliefs include,  <i>I am unsafe</i>, or <i>I am abandoned/alone/unloved,</i> or <i>I am not enough.</i> 
                        <br><br>
                        ii. Conducting an audit of your emotional and behavioral patterns, isolating where they might have come from, and what they are trying to draw your attention to. Once we have isolated root cause, we will create conscious and effective ways of dealing with what lies at the root of such potentially harmful patterns. Examples of such patterns include pervasive irritation; or dysregulated responses to anger; or the suppression of anger.
                        <br><br>
                        iii. Building effective strategies and habits to cope with difficult emotions and situations in life, in relationship to self. Learning how to effectively process one’s emotions; separate negative emotions that are caused by potentially untrue <I> stories</I>, or unmet <I>needs</I>; and deal with those stories and needs in healthy, intelligent ways.
