                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">The European Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed that of all forms of suffering, 
                        that which is caused by our relationships with others is the most devastating. Contemporary research on attachment 
                        has conclusively shown that <i>all</i> human beings—including those of us that take pride in self-reliance and independence—are 
                        biologically wired for connection and attunement. However, we don't genetically inherit the skills or intuitions needed to grow healthy
                        and resilient relationships. As adults, and in the context of acceptance and non-judgement, many of us need to be shown and taught how.

                        I take a results-based approach to helping clients build thriving bonds with others. Together, we explore topics such as self-esteem, healthy and skilled conflict resolution, 
                        ending codependency and enmeshment, how to heal from breakups, and how to transform grief and loss. Some clients want to dive deeply into how to release resentment from 
                        relationships, and <i> truly</i> forgive; overcome loneliness or social anxiety; or master the fear of rejection.
