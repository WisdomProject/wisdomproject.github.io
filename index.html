          <div class="content-text">
            Creating a healthy, compassionate, self-understanding, and capable relationship to oneself and one's own emotions
            is critical to a life well-lived. Some of our focus areas include: Transforming depression, intrusive thinking, and sadness. Eliminating inner guilt & shame. Discovering and embracing one’s unique
            needs and values. Breaking through self-sabotage, and procrastination, and overcoming low- or high-level anxiety, for presence and peace-of-mind.

            The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates distilled what he believed to be the wisdom of all philosophy, simply: <i>Know Thyself.</i> 
            Coming to do so, and taking charge of what we discover, will be the keystone of the work we do together.<br><br> <a href="self.html">Read more &#8594;</a></div>

          <h1><b><u>Relationships with Others:</u></b> Meaningful connection, deep and resilient love. </h1>
          <div class="content-text">In his <i>Interpersonal Theory</i>, American psychiatrist Harry Stack Sullivan sketched out his belief that human personalities are constructed within social contexts. In other words, without other people around to shape us, we would not have personalities. I hold that working on your relationship to others: how you might esteem their opinions, or not; the ways you might feel safe to be vulnerable around your loved ones, or not; how you may value your interpersonal connections, or not; can have revolutionary effects on every area of life. <a href="others.html">Read more &#8594;</a></div>

          <h1><b><u>A Career to Love:</u></b> Abundance and fulfillment in work.</h1>
          <div class="content-text">In the 25 or so wealthiest countries in the world, and amongst the quickly growing middle- and upper classes across much of the rest of the planet, 
            the 'problem of plenty' that has plagued humanity for the vast majority of our evolutionary history has largely been solved. 
           <br><br> However, though we have enough food, water, and shelter to go around—for the most part and for most people—true fulfillment in a 
            job and career seems as elusive as it always has been. But this needn't be the case, and is an eminently solvable problem—if only we are 
            given the tools we need, not taught in school or by our parents, to systematically work through the internal and external barriers 
            that stand in the way of the career of our dreams. <a href="career.html">Read more &#8594;</a></div>

          <div style="font-size: 24pt;"><b>On my Coaching & Counselling method:</b> With a subject as complex and consequential as life guidance, it is no surprise that there are 
            almost as many views on what the correct approach is as there are those offering to provide them—and that those viewpoints 
            are debated furiously. <u>I cannot, and do not claim to, be the counsellor for everyone, and am upfront about what underpins my
             work: (i) Scientific empiricism, (ii) the importance of self-understanding, and (iii) work directed towards <i>subconscious</i> 
             growth and transformation.</u> All three pillars exist in the context of the emotional openness, care, humor, levity, and responsibility I hope to bring 
             to my client relationships as a counsellor. <a href="iat_approach.html">Read more about my approach &#8594;</a></div>

          <div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 20px;">
            <p style="margin-top: 0px;">I began my training as a psychologist in Integrated Attachment Theory (IAT) with Dr. Thais Gibson in 2020, and completed my certification as an IAT coach in early 2024. 
              Prior to opening my counseling and coaching private practice, I worked as a corporate strategy consultant in New York City, and started 
              a concurrent research appointment with behavioral economists Dr. Karla Hoff and Nobel-prizewinner Dr. Joseph Stiglitz at Columbia 
              University.
              <br> <br>
              
              Although I have an extensive background in academia and in industry, I find the most joy and purpose working one-on-one with people seeking support in a coaching and counselling context. My prior training and continued intellectual interests in psychology, psychotherapy, trauma studies, philosophy, and social thought undergird the work that I do with my clients.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div style="flex: 1; margin-left: 20px;">
            <p style="margin-top: 0px;"> 
              The journey that brought me to this work began when I was a patient in conventional psychotherapy myself—posessing the outward trappings of a high paying job and prestigious education, but 
              struggling deeply with poor mental health, subterranean aimlessness, and painful relationships. Though therapy was marginally helpful for me,
              I was frustrated that I was spending tens of thousands of dollars and many hundreds of hours going around in circles, not getting the depth of 
              support I felt I needed, and failing to make tangible progress in shifting deeply-set self-destructive patterns in my career and in love.
              Discovering the community of developmental psychopathologists that included Drs. Bessel van der Kolk, Gabor Maté, and Dante Cicchetti—and Dr. Gibson's approach to targeted 
              interventions at the subconscious level of mind—proved to be an inflection point, and set me on the course to the work I do today.
              <br><br>
              <center>❊</center>
              <br><br>
              I spend most of my time between New York City, Berlin, and Bengaluru; though my heart lies in the wildernesses 
              of Vermont and the California Eastern Sierra. I grew up in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Myanmar—as a 
              child of expat parents from India—and attended international schools with kids from all over the world.
              <br> <br>
              I was educated at the United World College of South-East Asia, Yale-NUS College, Deep Springs College, and Columbia University.
