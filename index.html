              The European Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed that of all forms of suffering,
              that which we feel in our interpersonal relationships is the most devastating. Meaningful connections with
              others, and deep, resilient love,
              are emperically demonstrated cornerstones of mental health. But healthy
              love is not just a feeling—it is also a teachable skill.
            </p>
            <p>
              I take a results-based approach to helping clients thrive in their relationships. The product of our
              sessions is a gestalt:
              Clarity and confidence within yourself, along with the relational tools you need to go out and build the
              relationships you desire.

            <p style="margin-top:0px;">
              Calm, presence, self-connection, and mastery over one's emotions are essential components of a good life.
              Babies are not born with the anxiety, emotional detachment, addictive behaviors, depression, or
              skittishness
              that can plague us in later years—and, that which has been conditioned into us can be healed from.
              You will leave our work together equipped with tools to emotionally understand and regulate yourself with
              skill, and—leveraging adult neuroplasticity—real, lasting
              breakthroughs in how you feel day-to-day.

              Those of us with smartphones, health insurance plans, and potable, running water
              lead lives of such material abundance as human history has never known.
              But, do we truly savor the fruits of our progress? If we cannot
              enjoy what we already have, what makes us think that more will bring us the contentment we seek? Our goal
              together is to create the conditions for abundance in your
              finances—both in your bank account, and in your mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, despite the material wealth our institutional and economic sciences have produced,
              it can seem that true fulfillment in a
              job seems no easier to find. However, building a life where we earn heartily while doing something we love
              is a realistic, and important goal. Together, we will dismantle the internal and external barriers
              that stand in the way of the career of your dreams.

            with Dr. Thais Gibson in 2020, and completed my certification as an IAT coach in early 2024.

            <b>The journey that brought me to this work</b> began when I was a patient in conventional
            psychotherapy—posessing the outward trappings of a high paying job and prestigious
            education, but struggling with subterranean aimlessness, depression, anxiety, and
            painful patterns in the relationships that mattered most to me.

            Though therapy was marginally helpful, I was
            frustrated that I was spending tens of thousands of dollars and many hundreds of hours
            going around in circles, not getting the specificity and skill of support I felt I needed, and
            failing to make tangible progress towards my goals in work and love. Discovering
            the community of developmental psychopathologists that included Dr. Bessel van
            der Kolk of Boston University's School of Medicine, Dr. Gabor Maté, and Dr. Dante Cicchetti
            of Harvard and the University of Rochester—and Dr. Gibson's approach to targeted
            interventions at the subconscious level of mind—proved to be an inflection point,
            and set me on the course to the work I do today.

        <div class="col collapsible" style="flex: 1;">
          <p class="faq-title">Are you a 'therapist'? Do you offer psychotherapy?</p>
          <p class="faq-content">In the United States, a 'psychotherapist' is an individual who has been licensed by
            their State to practice a certain form of
            talk-based mental health care.
            I am <i>not</i> a psychotherapist, nor do I practice talk-based therapy. My client work is results-based,
            time-bound, and focusses instead on targeting ideal life outcomes
            and psychosocial challenges at their root.
            My method involves teaching transferrable emotional and interpersonal skills,
            as well as employing tools that leverage neuroplasticity to help the client heal and grow at the
            subconscious (or, 'pre-rational') level of mind.
            Please see <a href="iat_approach.html">On Methodology &#8594;</a> to read more
            about the similarities and differences between conventional psychotherapy and what I offer.

        <div class="col collapsible" style="flex: 1;">
          <p class="faq-title">Why did you not choose not to pursue psychotherapeutic licensure in New York State?</p>
          <p class="faq-content">In short, because degree programs that terminate in licensure do not necessarily
            equip
            putative therapists with the skills they
            need to succeed. To be sure, there are many traditionally trained psychotherapists and psychiatrists
            who do incredible work for their clients.
            However, vocational degree programs in mental health counselling in the United States
            do not necessarily teach licensees how to lead healthier lives, build deep and trusting relationships,
            heal
            traumatic emotional imprints, or navigate grief, uncertainty, or death.
            They do not ask difficult questions about the ideological and cultural assumptions that underlie
            accredited models of 'mental health'.
            Nor do these programs equip licensees with the pedagogical and interpersonal tools to teach their clients
            how to
            take charge of their own growth—which I believe is a key responsibility of an effective coach or counsellor.
            <br><br>The degree-granting programs that exist in Western countries are a product
            of their zeitgeist: A medicalized culture that focusses on pharmaceuticals to deal with outward symptoms
            of emotional pain, spiritual suffering, and relational dysfunction; and that
            treats the subjective substance of life as beyond the pale of scientific study. While this is changing,
            the radical
            paradigm shifts that are needed in governing institutions such as the American Psychiatric Association
            (APA) are lagging well behind fast-moving scientific
            criticisms of 20th Century Western psychiatry.

            <br><br>
            <!-- TODO(Aadit): This could benefit from some links. CBT, DBT, IFS, etc. Link to your certificate too. -->
            Beyond my education as a psychologist and philosopher of science at Columbia University, I am certified in Integrated
            Attachment Theory coaching—and as part of the certification process, was expected to learn from many of
            the best models,
            certifications, and schools of thought that conventional therapists also draw on. These include CBT, DBT,
            and IFS. However, IAT goes further than these modalities
            in incorporating findings from 21st Century neuroscience relating to neuroplasticity, the collapsing of
            mind-body duality, research on
            nervous system function, science-backed Mindfulness-based techniques, and the empirical observations of
            researchers such as those at the Gottman Institute and the Trauma Research Foundation.
            <br><br>
            To sum up, poetically: I chose to do this work because I was not able to find a therapist or traditional
            counselor who could help me, when I was at my moment of
            deepest need. The frustration I had with the system as a patient set me on the course to take my healing
            into my own hands, and to do what I do today, with clients seeking
            impactful insights and real results.

              running up against major deficiencies in the way American instutitions and academics dealt with the treatment of post-traumatic stress
              in the country's ex-military population. Since then, Dr. van der Kolk has made major contributions to the field, primarily by popularizing
              the importance of a psychosocial and emotional understanding of trauma, and through his founding of the Trauma Research Foundation—one
              of the most influential catalysts for scientific research in this field. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I also draw from the work of Dr. Thais Gibson, Dr. Stephen Porges, Dr. Dante Cicchetti, Dr. Antonio Damasio,
            Alain de Botton, Dr. Richard Schwartz, and Dr. Ron Siegel, among others.

          <p class="faq-title">How many sessions will we need together?</p>
          <p class="faq-content">The answer is highly dependent on your goals, and where you are on your journey
            towards where you want to be across the major areas of your life.
            For a rough range, however: Some clients with very specific goals
            are satisfied with eight to fifteen sessions. Others, who want to do deep and holistic work across many areas choose
            to
            do between twenty and thirty-five sessions in total, over the course of six months to a
            year.
            <br>
            <br>
            Coaching and counselling is time-bound. We will design a program together in our first few sessions, which
            will give you a clearer idea of how long the process of learning the skills you need to succeed is
            estimated to take. Once you
            are satisfied that you are sufficiently equipped, I will encourage you to terminate our sessions together
            and apply your new skills and knowledge on your own terms!
            <br><br>
            I will stress here that coaching and counselling is a joint venture, between the client and the practitioner. 
            It's my responsibility to give you the psychoeducation you need, and to 
            give you exercises to complete on your own time, which will move you towards your goal. It is, however, incumbent upon you to do the 
            heavy lifting of executing those exercises in your own time, and making time in your daily routine for personal growth work. In other words, the timeline is
            in your hands.

          <p class="faq-title">Why did you decide become a counselor and coach?</p>
          <p class="faq-content">I emerged into young adulthood suffering from depression, anxiety, a lack of
            authentic
            direction in my career, and painful patterns in my
            intimate relationships. I needed to figure out how to live a good life from scratch.
            I spent many years in therapy, finding out that conventional psychotherapy was not a good fit, and
            conventional psychopharmacology was at best a way to
            alleviate the symptoms of deeply-rooted yet eminently solveable emotional, relational, and life
            challenges. I needed something I believed was more results-oriented and effective
            in its treatment, and rigorous in establishing truth-claims (i.e., in answering the questions: What is at
            the <i>root</i> of the problem? And, how can we establish that our claims
            are both valid and true?).

            I subsequently decided to apply my education in philosophy and the natural sciences to trauma studies, the
            Psychotherapeutic Method, and
            to Integrated Attachment Theory.

          <p class="faq-title">In a nutshell, what is the goal of our work together?</p>
          <p class="faq-content">To do the subconscious healing work and practical skills-building required to develop
            thriving, secure, and
            deep bonds with others; a healthy, compassionate, and illuminated relationship to yourself; a clarified
            understanding of your proclivities and talents, and where they
            meet the world's needs for labor; and to equip you
            to deal with the inevitable difficulties of living even
            the best and most successful life with calm, charm, and wisdom.
