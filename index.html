             ending codependency and enmeshment, how to heal from breakups, and how to transform grief and loss. Some clients want to dive deeply into how to release resentment from 
             relationships, and <i> truly</i> forgive; overcome loneliness or social anxiety; or master the fear of rejection.

            <p style="margin-top: 0px;"><b>I began my training as a psychologist</b> in Integrated Attachment Theory (IAT) with Dr. Thais Gibson in 2020, and completed my certification as an IAT coach in early 2024. 
              Prior to opening my counseling and coaching private practice, I worked as a corporate strategy consultant in New York City, and started 
              a concurrent research appointment with behavioral economists Dr. Karla Hoff and Nobel-prizewinner Dr. Joseph Stiglitz at Columbia 
              University.
            </p>
            <p>
              
              Although I have an extensive background in academia and in industry,
              I find the most joy and purpose working one-on-one with people seeking support
              in a coaching and counselling context. My prior training and continued intellectual
              interests in psychology, psychotherapy, trauma studies, philosophy, and social
              thought undergird the work that I do with my clients.

            <p>
              <b>The journey that brought me to this work</b> began when I was a patient in conventional
              psychotherapy—posessing the outward trappings of a high paying job and prestigious
              education, but struggling with subterranean aimlessness, depression, anxiety, and
              painful patterns in relationships.

              <!-- TODO(Aadit): Add links to people's practices/websites -->
              Though therapy was marginally helpful, I was 
              frustrated that I was spending tens of thousands of dollars and many hundreds of hours
              going around in circles, not getting the depth of support I felt I needed, and
              failing to make tangible progress towards my goals in work and love. Discovering
              the community of developmental psychopathologists that included Dr. Bessel van
              der Kolk of Boston University's School of Medicine,  Dr. Gabor Maté, and Dr. Dante Cicchetti
              of Harvard and the University of Rochester—and Dr. Gibson's approach to targeted 
              interventions at the subconscious level of mind—proved to be an inflection point,
              and set me on the course to the work I do today.

      <!-- TODO(Ross): Make this single-column with collapsible text: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp-->
      <div class="row">
        <!-- TODO(Aadit): Add an FAQ describing what coaching is like the one for therapist. It should be similar to the one below and also link to your longer writeup. -->
        <div class="col" style="flex: 1;">
          <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 0px;">Are you a 'therapist'? Do you offer psychotherapy?</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In the United States, a 'psychotherapist' is an individual who has been licensed by their State to practice mental health counseling.
            <!-- TODO(Aadit): Add something about there existing other people in this industry who are not psychotherapists, and more something about what you do. It's a bit scary as it stands. -->
            I am <i>not</i> a psychotherapist. However, there are broad overlaps in the goals I and a psychotherapist might have in our work with you. 
            Please see <a style="color: #fcedb6;" href="iat_approach.html">On Methodology &#8594;</a> to read more about the similarities and differences between conventional psychotherapy and what I offer. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col" style="flex: 1;">
          <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 0px;">Why did you not choose not to pursue psychotherapeutic licensure in New York State?</p>
          <!-- TODO(Aadit): There are many talented people who are licensed therapists, but you don't think the degree programs necessarily give these skills. -->
          <!-- Comes across a little aggressive. -->
          <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In short, because degree programs that terminate in licensure do not necessarily equip putative therapists with the skills they 
            need to succeed. Currently, vocational degree programs in mental health counseling in the United States
            do not necessarily teach licensees how to lead healthier lives, build deep and trusting relationships, process their emotions skilfully, navigate grief or death; nor do they 
            give licensees the pedagogical tools to teach their clients and patients how to do so. The degree-granting programs that exist in Western countries are a product
            of their zeitgeist: A medicalized culture that focusses on pharmaceuticals to deal with outward symptoms of mental ill-health, and that 
            treats the emotional and spiritual substance of life as beyond the pale of scientific study. Course content that can loosely be described as 
            dealing with root cause focuses primarily on a circumscribed set of 
            psychologic and psychotherapeutic tools (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or 20th Century Developmental Psychology); an understanding of the legal and 
            ethical structure that regulates licensed clinical care; and the principles of social work—not on the multi-faceted and deeply introspective process necessary to sufficiently equip people with a robust emotional education, the tools to heal from traumatic pasts, or answer some of the thorniest questions in life.
            <!-- TODO(Aadit): Before this is a long-ass sentence. -->
            The expectation in the U.S. model is that clinicians,
             once licensed, pursue certifications and continuing education to help them do their jobs.
            <br><br>
            <!-- TODO(Aadit): This could benefit from some links. CBT, DBT, IFS, etc. Link to your certificate too. -->
            Beyond my education as a psychologist and philosopher of science at Columbia, I am certified in Integrated Attachment Theory coaching—and as part of the certification process, was expected to learn from many of the best models,
             certifications, and schools of thought that conventional therapists also draw on. These include CBT, DBT, and IFS. However, being untethered from the yoke of 
             20th Century psychiatrics, IAT also incorporates findings from 21st Century neuroscience relating to neuroplasticity, the collapsing of mind-body duality, research on 
             nervous system function, science-backed Mindfulness-based modalities, and the empirical observations of 
             researchers such as those at the Gottman Institute and the Trauma Research Foundation.
            <br><br>
            To sum up, poetically: I chose to enter this career because I was not able to find a therapist or traditional counselor who could help me, when I was at my moment of 
            deepest need. The frustration I had with the system as a patient set me on the course to take my healing into my own hands, and to do the work I do today, with clients seeking 
            impactful insights and real results. </p>

          <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Dr. Gabor Maté, Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, Dr. Thais Gibson, Dr. Stephen Porges, Dr. Dante Cicchetti, Dr. Antonio Damasio,

          <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The answer is highly dependent on your goals, and where you are on your journey towards the ideal outcomes in major areas of your life
             (Relationships, Career, Financial, Emotional/Spiritual, Mental/Intellectual and Physical Health/Environment). For a rough range, however: Some clients with specific focus areas
              are satisfied with eight sessions, others, who want to do deep and holistic work across all areas choose to do between 20 and 30 sessions in total, over the course of six months to a 
              year.
            <br><br>
            Coaching and counseling is time-bound. We will design a program together in our first few sessions, which will give us a clearer idea of how long the process is estimated to take. Once you
            are satisfied that you are sufficiently equipped, I will encourage you to terminate our sessions together and apply your new skills and knowledge on your own terms! </p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 0px;">Why did you decide become a counselor and coach?</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">I emerged into young adulthood suffering from depression, anxiety, a lack of authentic direction in my career, and painful patterns in my 
            intimate relationships. I needed to figure out how to live a good life from scratch.
             I spent many years in therapy, finding out that conventional psychotherapy was not a good fit, and conventional psychopharmacology was at best a way to 
             alleviate the symptoms of deeply-rooted yet eminently solveable emotional and life challenges. I needed something I believed was more results-oriented and effective 
             in its treatment, and rigorous in establishing truth-claims (i.e., in answering the questions: What is at the <i>root</i> of the problem? And, how can we establish that our claim 
             is true, scientifically?). 
             <!-- TODO(Aadit): Fix the sentence below. -->
             I subsequently decided to apply my education in philosophy and the natural sciences to trauma studies—learning about the Psychotherapeutic Method from scratch—and
              to Integrated Attachment Theory.
