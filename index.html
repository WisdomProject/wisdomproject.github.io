              Those of us with smartphones, health insurance plans, and potable, running water

              But, do we truly savor these fruits of our progress? If we cannot

            psychotherapy—posessing the outward trappings of a high paying job and prestigious
            education, but struggling with subterranean aimlessness, depression, anxiety, and
            painful patterns in the relationships that mattered most to me.

            Though therapy was marginally helpful, I was
            frustrated that I was spending thousands of dollars and many hundreds of hours
            going around in circles, not getting the specificity and skill of support I felt I needed, and
            failing to make tangible progress towards my goals in work and love. Discovering
            the community of developmental psychopathologists that included Dr. Bessel van
            der Kolk of Boston University's School of Medicine, Dr. Gabor Maté, and Dr. Dante Cicchetti
            of Harvard and the University of Rochester—and Dr. Gibson's approach to targeted
            interventions at the subconscious level of mind—proved to be an inflection point,
            and set me on the course to the work I do today.

          <p class="faq-content">In the United States, a 'psychotherapist' is an individual who has been licensed by
            their State to practice a specific form of
            talk-based mental health care.
            I am <i>not</i> a psychotherapist, nor do I practice talk-based therapy. My client work is results-based,
            time-bound, and focusses instead on targeting ideal life outcomes
            and psychosocial challenges at their root.
            My method involves teaching transferrable emotional and interpersonal skills,
            as well as employing tools that leverage neuroplasticity to help clients heal and grow at the
            subconscious (or, 'pre-rational') level of mind.

          <p class="faq-content">In short, because degree programs that terminate in licensure do not necessarily
            equip
            putative therapists with the skills they
            need to succeed. To be sure, there are many traditionally trained psychotherapists and psychiatrists
            who do incredible work for their clients.
            However, vocational degree programs in mental health counselling in the United States
            do not necessarily teach licensees how to lead healthier lives, build deep and trusting relationships,
            heal
            traumatic emotional imprints, or navigate grief, uncertainty, or death.
            They do not ask difficult questions about the ideological and cultural assumptions that underlie
            accredited models of 'mental health'.
            Nor do these programs equip licensees with the pedagogical and interpersonal tools to teach their clients
            how to
            take charge of their own growth, and render the therapist redundant over time—which I believe is a key
            responsibility of an effective coach or counsellor.
            <br><br>The degree-granting programs that exist in Western countries are a product
            of their zeitgeist: A medicalized culture that focusses on pharmaceuticals to deal with outward symptoms
            of emotional pain, spiritual suffering, and relational dysfunction; and that
            treats the subjective substance of life as beyond the pale of scientific study. While this is changing,
            the radical
            paradigm shifts that are needed in governing institutions such as the American Psychiatric Association
            (APA) are lagging well behind fast-moving scientific
            criticisms of 20th Century Western psychiatry.

            Beyond my education as a psychologist and philosopher of science at Columbia University, I am certified in
            Integrated
            Attachment Theory coaching—and as part of the certification process, was expected to learn from many of
            the best models,
            certifications, and schools of thought that conventional therapists also draw on. These include <a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" target="_blank">CBT &#8594;</a>, <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt" target="_blank">DBT &#8594;</a>,
            and <a href="https://ifs-institute.com/" target="_blank">IFS &#8594;</a>. However, IAT goes further than these modalities
            in incorporating findings from 21st Century neuroscience relating to neuroplasticity, the collapsing of
            mind-body duality, research on
            nervous system function, science-backed Mindfulness-based techniques, and the empirical observations of
            researchers such as those at the <a href="https://www.gottman.com/" target="_blank">Gottman Institute &#8594;</a> and the <a href="https://traumaresearchfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Trauma Research Foundation &#8594;</a>.
            <br><br>
            To sum up, poetically: I chose to do this work because I was not able to find a therapist or traditional
            counsellor who could help me, when I was at my moment of
            deepest need. The frustration I had with the system as a patient set me on the course to take my healing
            into my own hands, and to do what I do today, with clients seeking
            impactful insights and real results.

          <p class="faq-content"><a href="https://drgabormate.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Gabor Maté: &#8594;</a> One of
            the first Western thinkers to conclusively link
            addiction to trauma, abuse, and emotional neglect in the public consciousness. He brings incredible
            compassion to his research and his writing, and
            explores topics such as the collapsing of mind-body

            AD(H)D,

            Dr. van der Kolk's interest in trauma began when he was a staff psychiatrist at the Boston Veterans
            Administration's Outpatient Clinic,
            running up against major deficiencies in the way American instutitions and academics dealt with the
            treatment of post-traumatic stress
            in the country's ex-military population. Since then, Dr. van der Kolk has made major contributions to the
            field, primarily by popularizing
            the importance of a psychosocial and emotional understanding of trauma, and through his founding of the
            Trauma Research Foundation—one
            of the most influential catalysts for scientific research in this field.

          <p class="faq-title">How many sessions will we need together?</p>
          <p class="faq-content">The answer is highly dependent on your goals, and where you are on your journey
            towards where you want to be across the major areas of your life.
            For a rough range, however: Some clients with very specific goals
            are satisfied with eight to fifteen sessions. Others, who want to do deep and holistic work across many
            areas choose
            to
            do between twenty and thirty-five sessions in total, over the course of six months to a
            year.
            <br>
            <br>
            Coaching and counselling is time-bound. We will design a program together in our first few sessions, which
            will give you a clearer idea of how long the process of learning the skills you need to succeed is
            estimated to take. Once you
            are satisfied that you are sufficiently equipped, I will encourage you to terminate our sessions together
            and apply your new skills and knowledge on your own terms!
            <br><br>
            I will stress here that coaching and counselling is a joint venture, between the client and the
            practitioner.
            It's my responsibility to give you the psychoeducation you need, and to
            give you exercises to complete on your own time, which will move you towards your goal. It is, however,
            incumbent upon you to do the
            heavy lifting of executing those exercises, and making time in your daily routine for personal growth work.
            In other words, you will get
            from this process some multiple of what you are able to put in, and I am happy to work with you to build a
            timeline that meets your needs.

          <p class="faq-title">Why did you decide become a counsellor and coach?</p>
          <p class="faq-content">I emerged into young adulthood suffering from depression, anxiety, a lack of
            authentic
            direction in my career, and painful patterns in my
            intimate relationships. I needed to figure out how to live a good life from scratch.
            I spent many years in therapy, finding out that conventional psychotherapy was not a good fit, and
            conventional psychopharmacology was at best a way to
            alleviate the symptoms of deeply-rooted yet eminently solveable emotional, relational, and life
            challenges. I needed something I believed was more results-oriented and effective
            in its treatment, and rigorous in establishing truth-claims (i.e., in answering the questions: What is at
            the <i>root</i> of the problem? And, how can we establish that our claims
            are both valid and true?).

            I subsequently decided to apply my education in philosophy and the natural sciences to trauma studies, the
            Psychotherapeutic Method, and
            to Integrated Attachment Theory.
