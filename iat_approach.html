                        is no surprise that there are
                        almost as many views on what the <i>correct</i> approach is as there are those offering to
                        provide them—and that those viewpoints
                        are debated furiously. My work is very different from conventional coaching, psychotherapy, or
                        counselling, and is characterized by three pillars:
                    <ul style="font-size: 14pt;">
                        <li>(i) Scientific, peer-reviewed findings about psychosocial root cause,</li>
                        <li>(ii) An emphasis on the importance of potentially uncomfortable self-exploration, and</li>
                        <li>(iii) Actionable steps, designed to be taken outside of sessions, aimed at
                            <i>subconscious</i> growth and transformation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">
                        All three pillars exist in the context of the emotional openness, care, humor, and
                        responsibility I
                        hope to bring
                        to my client relationships as a counsellor.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">
                        Specifically, I practice a model of <i>coaching</i> and <i>counselling</i>, that work in
                        concert. Borrowing
                        from the popular adage,
                        "give a person a fish, and you feed them for a day; but teach a person to fish, and you feed
                        them
                        for a lifetime,"
                        I view 'counselling' as the process of giving the client fish, and 'coaching' as teaching them
                        to fish for themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">I am a counsellor
                        inasmuch as I invite you to come to sessions as you are, and to view our sessions as
                        compassionate, non-judgmental spaces where
                        we work together through anything and everything that you choose to bring. I am a coach, in that
                        my primary goal is to design a
                        program that helps you move towards your goals, and feel fulfilled on a fundamental, emotional
                        level.
                        At the point where you are satisfied of your ability to be an efficacious coach to yourself,
                        I will encourage you to terminate our sessions together.

                        <b>A key concept here is 're-parenting';</b> i.e., learning to use one's
                        rational, conscious faculties—which are within direct control—to re-wire the subconscious
                        (pre-rational) minds towards capacity and health.
                        As the conscious mind can only out-will or overpower the subconscious for very
                        short bursts of time, this last step—alongside the rigorous empirical grounding of all that I
                        teach, and my emphasis on the
                        importance of conscious self-knowledge—is perhaps most defining of the work I do,
                        <i>vis-à-vis</i> conventional psychotherapy or life coaching.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        In order to do the work of self-understanding and re-parenting, I employ frameworks drawn from
                        empirical study (such as
                        Integrated Attachment Theory, CBT, DBT, IFS, and the work of the Gottman Institute), and
                        insights on how our minds operate,
                        taken from the latest research in cognitive neuroscience and trauma-informed psychotherapeutic
                        methods. I am agnostic as to the
                        ideological or cultural source of the teaching and wisdom I espouse, so long as the concept can
                        be demonstrated empirically as
                        statistically significant, or by a process of logical proof. In this regard—and without meaning
                        to demean or detract from the
                        potential insights enabled by other methods—my approach differs most obviously from the guidance
                        one might receive from
                        theological sources, executive coaches, life coaches, 'new age' alternatives, or, indeed, from
                        conventional Western talk therapists.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        An analogy that I use to describe why I believe a critical approach to
                        truth-claims is important to helping clients meet their goals is that of auto mechanics.
                        Imagine a car rolls into a mechanic's shop, and the driver reports that something is wrong with
                        it.
                        A passable mechanic might conduct a limited diagnostic, and draw a conclusion that points to a
                        superficial fix
                        to a superficial problem. This might work temporarily, but unless the problem at the very lowest
                        level of causality
                        was addressed, the owner might be able to drive the car away with the issue ameliorated, but
                        they
                        would need to keep bringing it back into the shop eventually. This dynamic is how I would
                        describe
                        my experience with conventional Western psychotherapy.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">
                        A truly skilled mechanic, however, who has extensive training and knowledge about how vehicles
                        work, would be able to
                        isolate with as high a degree of accuracy as possible what the <i>root cause</i> of the problem
                        is. Knowing the nature of the problem that exists
                        at the lowest possible level inside-and-out, they'd be able to conduct whatever fixes were
                        necessary to get the
                        car running again. And, because they'd fixed this problem many times before, they'd be able to
                        use their experience with this type of issue
                        to do the job efficiently, without damaging other sensitive components as they complete it.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        I entered this field because I discovered that—unlike good auto mechanics—most psychotherapists,
                        coaches, or counsellors do not hold themselves to the standard of
                        understanding root cause at its lowest possible level. Psychodynamics,
                        psychiatry, and psychoanalysis—not to mention various forms of new-age healing, or life
                        coaching—rely on tools that might do more good than harm, but that
                        do not get to the heart of the matter.
                        An example of this might be: How do we know that talking about a traumatic event is palliative?
                        Because Freud said so (appeal to authority). Or, because people seem to feel better afterwards
                        (false cause).
                        I insist on an academic's approach to the acceptance or rejection of a theory: Is it
                        explanatory? Does it have robust predictive power? Is it parsimonious? And, is it
                        falsifiable? Clients that seek out my services tend to be looking not only for a caring and
                        emotionally open counsellor, but also a skilled practitioner, and an exacting thinker,
                        who takes justification of truth-claims seriously.

                        Emerging in Europe in the 19th Century and refined among the European diaspora in North America
                        in the 20th,
                        both Psychotherapy and Psychiatry are inextricably tied to European and Judeo-Christian cultural
                        approaches to psychosocial health.
                        Put very generally, Europeans would historically deal with their emotional pain by
                        <i>talking</i> about it with their priest or rabbi, and/or
                        <i>drinking</i> their sorrows away at the local tavern. Religious confession and attenant
                        pastoral care—or traditions
                        surrounding drinking as social lubricant, pasttime, and spiritual aid—served as the dual-pronged
                        mechanism by which Western Europeans would deal with their
                        suffering.
                        Contemporary Psychotherapy been tempered by Psychoanalysis, and in its time, Psychodynamics,
                        however it is still fundamentally of the same form as a Christian confession: It is discursive,
                        and employs narrative ways of understanding its subject matter
                        that rest, at their core, on faith (even if, now, the Godhead is no longer the Trinity or
                        Scripture, but is Freud, Jung, or the inventor of a particular psychodynamic
                        technique).
                        <br><br>Contemporary Psychiatry, on the other hand, emerged alongside late 20th Century advances
                        in encephalography, neurotransmitter research, and genomics, that allowed scientists to measure
                        electrical and chemical
                        activity in the brain. As what gets measured gets managed, neuroscientists latched on to what
                        data they had about how the mind works to create the advanced antipsychotic and antidepressant
                        drugs we see marketed today. However, Psychiatry's approach to dealing with emotional and
                        spiritual problems is unchanged from its pre-modern roots: Both alcohol and
                        Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ('SSRIs') such as Prozac, for example, are
                        fundamentally psychotropic drugs that temporarily manipulate brain chemistry to create
                        symptomatic relief.

                        <br><br>
                        Although the subject of the now secularized pastoral discussions and the composition of the
                        drugs that are prescribed to alleviate
                        'diseases' of mental health have become more advanced, as
                        potential palliatives to psychosocial trauma and aids to emotional education, Psychotherapy and
                        Psychiatry retain the same fundamental
                        shortcomings as their precursors. They fail to accurately address the root causes of emotional
                        distress and dysfunction, and to offer lasting
                        solutions that target these root issues.

                        <br><br>


                        Western psychodynamic psychotherapy traces its lineage to the work of Austrian philosopher and
                        neurologist Sigmund Freud, who
                        believed that much of human thought, emotion, and behavior is influenced by unconscious
                        processes. His research and writing
                        fundamentally challenged the European Enlightenment-era (Cartesian, Kantian) view of humans as
                        fully rational beings. A clinician
                        as well as a philosopher, Freud enumerated an elaborate theory of the psyche (introducing such
                        terms as Id, Ego, and Superego) <fill>

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        Currently, Psychodynamics has moved well beyond Freud, who died in Britain in 1939. However, the
                        practice of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy
                        continues to take as the answer to the questions, 'well, how do we know that this principle
                        holds?', or, 'how do we know that this process
                        works?', as fundamentally uninteresting: the appeal is to the authority of the thinker, such as
                        Freud, or Swiss and French psychiatrists
                        respectively, Carl Jung, or Jacques Lacan—or to the government, i.e., the university that taught
                        the course, or to the institutional body
                        that granted the license to practice.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        To be clear, I am not making the argument that Psychodynamic Psychotherapy is wrong. It is
                        entirely possible that a practice without a
                        rigorous relationship to truth-claims can still have something useful to offer. It is abundantly
                        clear to me, for instance, that
                        adherents to religious programs, or to 'alternative' methods gain some value from them. I am,
                        however, suggesting that my coaching and
                        counselling practice is different from all of the above in that it insists on a critical
                        relationship to etiology and foundational truth.
                        This makes my science-based coaching and counselling approach more suitable to those who,
                        perhaps, are not as good a fit for traditional
                        religions, or who have tried conventional psychotherapy but find it's not as results-oriented as
                        they would like—and, ultimately, who may
                        care more about knowing that what they're being taught in session is the product of peer-review
                        in an academic journal.
