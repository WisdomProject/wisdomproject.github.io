                        complete, standalone statement on how I view my work.
                    </p>
                    <p> <b>With a subject as complex and consequential as life guidance,</b>
                        it is no surprise that there are almost as many views on what the correct approach is as there
                        are those offering to
                        provide them—and that those viewpoints are debated furiously. My work differs from
                        conventional coaching,
                        psychodynamic psychotherapy, or counselling, and is characterized by three pillars:
                    <ul>
                        <li>(i) Scientific, peer-reviewed findings about neurobiological root cause,</li>
                        <li>(ii) An emphasis on the importance of potentially uncomfortable self-exploration, and</li>
                        <li>(iii) Actionable steps, designed to be taken outside of sessions, aimed at
                            <i>subconscious</i> growth and transformation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        All three pillars exist in the context of the emotional openness, loving-kindness, humor, and
                        responsibility
                        I hope to bring to my client relationships as a counsellor.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, I practice a model of coaching and counselling that work in
                        concert. Borrowing
                        from the popular adage,
                        <i>"give a person a fish, and you feed them for a day; but teach a person to fish, and you feed
                            them
                            for a lifetime,"</i><br>
                        <!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->I view 'counselling' as the process of giving the
                        client fish—which in this analogy is emotional support—and 'coaching'
                        as teaching them to fish—or eventually emotionally guide themselves. I am a counsellor inasmuch as I invite you to come to
                        sessions as you are, and to view our
                        sessions as compassionate, non-judgmental spaces where we work together through anything and
                        everything that you choose to bring. I
                        am a coach, in that my primary objective is to design a program that helps you move towards your
                        goals, and feel fulfilled on a
                        fundamental, emotional level—by giving you exercises to complete in your own time, outside of
                        sessions. Crucially, this means that
                        our work together is a joint venture. It is my role and responsibility to lead you through the
                        process, and provide the tools and
                        psychoeducation you need to keep experiencing breakthroughs. It is incumbent upon you, however,
                        to apply those tools in your
                        day-to-day life, and to do the work necessary to see growth happen at the subconscious level of
                        mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike in conventional psychotherapy, executive coaching, or life coaching, my approach allows
                        you to do as much or as little work outside of sessions as you choose; knowing that the speed at
                        which you experience changes and progress towards your goals is largely within your control.

                    </p>

                    <p><b>While the work we will be doing together will be bespoke, typically I structure our sessions with the following objectives
                        in mind:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. To understand, audit, and re-condition the emotional imprints left by trauma, fear or insecurity—or, in other words, the <i>core wounds</i>
                            that underlie our beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and actions.</li>
                            <li>2. To understand, audit, and learn to effectively meet our needs ourselves. To understand our subconscious relationship 
                                expectations, and how they may refer to our partner's or friends'.
                            </li>
                            <li>3. To understand, audit, and heal the root cause(s) of our negative emotional patterns (such as impatience, irritation, anger, worry, loneliness
                                and desperation).
                            </li>
                            <li>4. To understand our relationship to boundaries, and learn how to assert healthy—firm-but-flexible—boundaries, in the context
                                of interdependence (as opposed to codependence, or hyper-independence).
                            </li>
                            <li>5. To understand the way we communicate, and learn potentially better, more effective ways to be heard, understood, and supported
                                by others.
                            </li>
                            <li>6. To understand, audit, and re-condition our behavioral coping mechanisms—so that we can stop living life on autopilot,
                                and use our conscious minds to build lives out of premeditation, as opposed to predestination.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">❊</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>A key concept that we will be leveraging in our work together is 're-parenting';</b> i.e.,
                        learning to use one's rational, conscious faculties—which are within direct control—to
                        recondition the subconscious (pre-rational) mind towards capacity, judiciousness, and health. 
                        The conscious mind can only out-will or overpower the subconscious for very short bursts of
                        time; and this is precisely why many fail to keep their new years' resolutions, struggle with addiction, or fail to break counterproductive 
                        patterns in intimate relationships. The process of re-parenting—well as the rigorous empirical grounding of all that I teach, and my
                        emphasis on the importance of conscious self-knowledge—is perhaps most defining of the work we
                        will be doing together.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        In order to do the work of self-exploration and re-parenting, I employ frameworks drawn from
                        empirical study (such as <a href="https://www.innateprosper.com/post/integrated-attachment-theory-understanding-relationships-with-thais-gibson" target="_blank">Integrated Attachment Theory</a> (IAT), <a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" target="_blank">CBT</a>, <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt" target="_blank">DBT</a>, <a href="https://ifs-institute.com/" target="_blank">IFS</a>, and the work of the
                        <a href="https://www.gottman.com/" target="_blank">Gottman Institute</a>), and insights on how our minds operate, taken from the latest research in
                        cognitive neuroscience and trauma-informed psychotherapeutic methods. I am agnostic as to the
                        ideological or cultural source of the teaching and wisdom I espouse, so long as the concept can
                        be demonstrated empirically as statistically significant, or by a process of logical proof. In
                        this regard—and without meaning to demean or detract from the potential insights enabled by
                        other methods—my approach differs most obviously from the guidance one might receive from
                        theological sources, executive coaches, life coaches, 'new age' alternatives, or, indeed, from
                        conventional Western talk therapists. I insist on falsifiability, and on the ability to describe
                        in detail to my clients <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> a particular process is supposed to work.


                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">❊</p>
                    <p>

                        <b>A second critical concept in my practice is that of <i>root cause.</i></b> To describe the importance of this idea by analogy, I borrow from auto mechanics:
                        <!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->Imagine a car rolls into a mechanic's shop, and the
                        driver reports that the vehicle vibrates dangerously at highway speeds. A passable mechanic's superficial fix to a
                        superficial problem would simply be to replace the tires, which are easily observable and are
                        unevenly worn, and appear to be directly responsible for the reverberations.
                        However, without understanding and treating the <i>cause</i> of the worn tires—at
                        the <i>root</i> of the causal chain—the problem is not yet solved. By contrast, a good
                        mechanic would know to look for this root cause, and would be able to identify and fix it
                        efficiently and accurately.
                        <br><!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->In this case, let’s suppose that the root cause
                        was an electronics issue that caused the suspension system to behave abnormally. This caused the
                        tires to bear uneven weight, and wear out at different rates. Our good mechanic understands
                        vehicles inside-and-out and has dealt with this problem before, and so can fix the issue—this
                        time, permanently.
                        <!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->The dynamic with the passable mechanic is how I would
                        describe my personal experience with conventional Western psychotherapy. Often, conventional
                        psychotherapy can feel like an endless process of returning to the therapist, who offers a kindly listening ear, 
                        but only temporary relief. During talk therapy, the goal—much less the process—is sometimes unclear. This is because, in many therapeutic relationships, there is little
                        work being done at that root cause level, where the problem lies. And—as in any endeavor—without a deep and specific understanding of a problem,
                        solving it will be impossible.




                    </p>

                    <p>

                        I entered this field because I discovered that—unlike good auto mechanics—many psychotherapists,
                        coaches, counsellors, theologians and personal growth gurus do not hold themselves to the
                        standard of understanding root cause at its lowest possible level. Western psychodynamics,
                        psychiatry, and psychoanalysis—not to mention various forms of new-age healing, or life
                        coaching—rely on methods that might do more good than harm, but often do not get to the heart of
                        the matter. I insist on the ability to explain root cause to my clients, cogently and clearly, as well as an academic's approach to the acceptance or rejection of 
                        these theories. Are they
                        explanatory? Do they have robust predictive power? Are they parsimonious? And, are they falsifiable?
                    </p><p>
                        Clients that seek my services tend to be looking not only for a caring and emotionally open
                        counsellor—with whom they can be honest with, and bare their whole selves—but also a skilled psychologist, open-minded scientist, and an exacting thinker, who
                        takes justification of truth-claims in the palliative process seriously. These clients want to be guided along a journey that is oriented
                        towards results, and that offers clear directions to get there—as quickly as the circumstances of their lives and biochemistry of their minds will allow. They are willing to 
                        do the hard work required to see the results they desire, given the tools and guidance they need to succeed, and are excited to work with someone who invites tough questions on 
                        priors, process, and outcomes.
