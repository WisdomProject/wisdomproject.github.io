                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;"> <b>With a subject as complex and consequential as life guidance, it is no surprise that there are 
                        almost as many views on what the <i>correct</i> approach is as there are those offering to provide them—and that those viewpoints 
                        are debated furiously.</b> My work is very different from conventional coaching, psychotherapy, or counselling, and is characterized by three pillars:
                        (i) Scientific, peer-reviewed findings about psychosocial root cause,
                        (ii) An emphasis on the importance of potentially uncomfortable self-exploration, and
                        (iii) Homework, in the form of actionable steps, aimed at <i>subconscious</i> growth and transformation.
                        All three pillars exist in the context of the emotional openness, care, humor, and responsibility I hope to bring 
                         to my client relationships as a counsellor. 

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">
                        Specifically, I practice a model of <i>coaching</i> and <i>counselling</i>, that work in concert. Borrowing
                        from the popular adage,
                        "give a person a fish, and you feed them for a day; but teach them to fish, and you feed them
                        for a lifetime,"
                        I view 'counselling' as the process of giving the client fish, and 'coaching' as teaching a person
                        to fish for themselves. 
                        <!-- TODO(Ross):Insert tab space here-->
                        <br>I am a counsellor
                        inasmuch as I invite you to come to sessions as you are, and to view our sessions as
                        compassionate, non-judgmental spaces where
                        we work together through anything and everything that you choose to bring. I am a coach, in that
                        my primary goal is to design a
                        program that helps you move towards understanding yourself thoroughly, assign homework so that you can make progress outside of sessions, and eventually teach you to become your own
                        counsellor.
                        At that point, I will encourage you to terminate our sessions together.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">
                        
                        <b>A key concept here is 're-parenting';</b> i.e., learning to use one's 
                        rational, conscious faculties—which are within our direct control—to heal the traumatic emotional imprints on our subconscious (pre-rational) minds. As the conscious mind can only out-will or overpower the subconscious for very 
                        short bursts of time, this last step—alongside the rigorous empirical grounding of all that I teach, and my emphasis on the 
                        importance of conscious self-knowledge—is perhaps most defining of the work I do, <i>vis-à-vis</i> conventional psychotherapy or life coaching.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        In order to do the work of self-understanding and re-parenting, I employ frameworks drawn from
                        empirical study (such as
                        Integrated Attachment Theory, CBT, DBT, IFS, and the work of the Gottman Institute), and
                        insights on how our minds operate,
                        taken from the latest research in cognitive neuroscience and trauma-informed psychotherapeutic
                        methods. I am agnostic as to the
                        ideological or cultural source of the teaching and wisdom I espouse, so long as the concept can
                        be demonstrated empirically as
                        statistically significant, or by a process of logical proof. In this regard—and without meaning
                        to demean or detract from the
                        potential insights enabled by other methods—my approach differs most obviously from the guidance
                        one might receive from
                        theological sources, executive coaches, 'new age' alternatives, or, indeed, from more
                        conventional Western talk therapists.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        An analogy that I use to describe why I put so much stress on a critical approach to
                        truth-claims when it comes to the mind and psychology is that of auto mechanics.
                        Imagine a car rolls into a mechanic's shop, and the driver reports that it's drifting to one
                        side at highway speed. A passable mechanic would conduct a limited diagnostic,
                        and conclude that the issue was resolveable with a wheel alignment—because the front right wheel
                        was slightly off axis, 'causing' the drift. This might work as a temporary solution.
                        But, it takes a truly skilled mechanic,
                        with extensive training and knowledge about how vehicles work, to
                        isolate with as high a degree of accuracy as possible what the <i>root cause</i> of the problem
                        is. The sensor which regulates the suspension is damaged, causing changes in wheel
                        alignment over time. Now that the mechanic has identified what lies at the source of the
                        problem,
                        at the lowest possible level, they'd be able to conduct whatever fixes were necessary to get the
                        car running again—using their experience with this type of issue
                        to do the job efficiently, without damaging other sensitive components as they complete it.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        I entered this field because I discovered that—unlike good auto mechanics—most psychotherapists, coaches, or counsellors do not hold themselves to the standard of 
                        understanding root cause at its lowest possible level. Psychodynamics, 
                        psychiatry, and psychoanalysis—not to mention various forms of new-age healing, or life coaching—rely on what are strictly speaking logical fallacies, as opposed to rigorous etiologic understanding. 
                        An example of this might be: How do we know that talking about a traumatic event is palliative? Because Freud said so (appeal to authority). Or, because people seem to feel better afterwards (false cause).
                        I insist on an academic's approach to the acceptance or rejection of a theory: Is it explanatory? Does it have robust predictive power? Is it parsimonious? And, is it 
                        falsifiable? Clients that seek out my services tend to be looking not only for a caring and emotionally open counsellor, but also a skilled practitioner, and an exacting thinker,
                        who takes justification of truth-claims seriously.

                    <p style="text-align: center;">❊</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">
                        An exhaustive attempt to describe and compare the major therapies readily available in countries
                        such as the United States
                        and Germany would be the subject of a doctoral dissertation, so I limit myself here to an
                        overview and comparison of two
                        approaches: Conventional Western talk therapy (of the specifically Psychodynamic sort), and
                        Integrated Attachment Theory—the
                        latter of which constitutes the basis of the deep work we will be doing together.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        Western psychodynamic psychotherapy traces its lineage to the work of Austrian philosopher and
                        neurologist Sigmund Freud, who
                        believed that much of human thought, emotion, and behavior is influenced by unconscious
                        processes. His research and writing
                        fundamentally challenged the European Enlightenment-era (Cartesian, Kantian) view of humans as
                        fully rational beings. A clinician
                        as well as a philosopher, Freud enumerated an elaborate theory of the psyche (introducing such
                        terms as Id, Ego, and Superego) <fill>

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        Currently, Psychodynamics has moved well beyond Freud, who died in Britain in 1939. However, the
                        practice of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy
                        continues to take as the answer to the questions, 'well, how do we know that this principle
                        holds?', or, 'how do we know that this process
                        works?', as fundamentally uninteresting: the appeal is to the authority of the thinker, such as
                        Freud, or Swiss and French psychiatrists
                        respectively, Carl Jung, or Jacques Lacan—or to the government, i.e., the university that taught
                        the course, or to the institutional body
                        that granted the license to practice.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">

                        To be clear, I am not making the argument that Psychodynamic Psychotherapy is wrong. It is
                        entirely possible that a practice without a
                        rigorous relationship to truth-claims can still have something useful to offer. It is abundantly
                        clear to me, for instance, that
                        adherents to religious programs, or to 'alternative' methods gain some value from them. I am,
                        however, suggesting that my coaching and
                        counselling practice is different from all of the above in that it insists on a critical
                        relationship to etiology and foundational truth.
                        This makes my science-based coaching and counselling approach more suitable to those who,
                        perhaps, are not as good a fit for traditional
                        religions, or who have tried conventional psychotherapy but find it's not as results-oriented as
                        they would like—and, ultimately, who may
                        care more about knowing that what they're being taught in session is the product of peer-review
                        in an academic journal.
