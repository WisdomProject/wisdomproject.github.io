                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;"> With a subject as complex and consequential as life guidance, it is no surprise that there are 
                        almost as many views on what the <i>correct</i> approach is as there are those offering to provide them—and that those viewpoints 
                        are debated furiously. My work is very different from conventional coaching, psychotherapy, or counselling, and is underpinned by: (i) Scientific, peer-reviewed findings about 
                        psychological root cause, (ii) a stress on the importance of potentially uncomfortable self-exploration, and (iii) actionable steps aimed towards <i>subconscious</i> (or, <i>pre-rational</i>) 
                         growth and transformation. All three pillars exist in the context of the emotional openness, care, humor, levity, and responsibility I hope to bring 
                         to my client relationships as a counsellor.

                         <br><br>
                         Specifically, I practice a model of coaching and counselling, that work in concert. Borrowing from the popular adage,
                        'give a person a fish, and you feed them for a day; but teach them to fish, and you feed them for a lifetime,' 
                        I view 'counselling' as the process of giving the client fish, and 'coaching' as teaching them to fish for themselves. I am a counsellor 
                        inasmuch as I invite you to come to sessions as you are, and to view our sessions as compassionate, non-judgmental spaces where 
                        we work together through anything and everything that you choose to bring. I am a coach, in that my primary goal is to design a 
                        program that helps you work to understand yourself thoroughly, and teach you to be your own counsellor. 

                        <br><br>
                        
                        One does so by learning to 're-parent' oneself; i.e., learning to use one's 
                        rational, conscious faculties—which are within our direct control—to work through the maladaptive subconscious imprints that have impressed 
                        themselves on to one's pre-rational mind. As the conscious mind can only out-will or overpower the subconscious for very 
                        short bursts of time, this last step—alongside the rigorous empirical grounding of all that I teach, and the emphasis on the 
                        importance of self-knowledge—completes the three pillars of my practice.

                        <br><br>

                        In order to do the work of self-understanding and re-parenting, I employ frameworks drawn from empirical study (such as 
                        Integrated Attachment Theory, CBT, DBT, IFS, and the work of the Gottman Institute), and insights on how our minds operate, 
                        taken from the latest research in cognitive neuroscience and trauma-informed psychotherapeutic methods. I am agnostic as to the 
                        ideological or cultural source of the teaching and wisdom I espouse, so long as the concept can be demonstrated empirically as 
                        statistically significant, or by a process of logical proof. In this regard—and without meaning to demean or detract from the 
                        potential insights enabled by other methods—my approach differs most obviously from the guidance one might receive from 
                        theological sources, executive coaches, 'new age' alternatives, or, indeed, from more conventional Western talk therapists.

                        <br><br>

                        An analogy that I use to describe why I put so much stress on a critical approach to truth-claims when it comes to the mind and psychology is that of auto mechanics. 
                        Imagine a car rolls into a mechanic's shop, and the driver reports that it's drifting to one side at highway speed. A passable mechanic would conduct a limited diagnostic,
                        and conclude that the issue was resolveable with a wheel alignment—because the front right wheel was slightly off axis, 'causing' the drift. This might work as a temporary solution. 
                        But, it takes a truly skilled mechanic, 
                        with extensive training and knowledge about how vehicles work, to 
                        isolate with as high a degree of accuracy as possible what the <i>root cause</i> of the problem is. The sensor which regulates the suspension is damaged, causing changes in wheel 
                        alignment over time. Now that the mechanic has identified what lies at the source of the problem,
                        at the lowest possible level, they'd be able to conduct whatever fixes were necessary to get the car running again—using their experience with this type of issue
                        to do the job efficiently, without damaging other sensitive components as they complete it.

                        <br><br>

                        I entered this field because I discovered that, unlike good auto mechanics, most psychotherapists, coaches, or counsellors do not hold themselves to the standard of 
                        understanding root cause at its lowest possible level. Psychodynamics, 
                        psychiatry, and psychoanalysis—not to mention various forms of new-age healing, or life coaching—rely on faith-based claims, as opposed to rigorous etiologic understanding.
                        I insist on an academic's approach to the acceptance or rejection of a theory: Is it explanatory? Does it have robust predictive power? Is it parsimonious? And, is it 
                        falsifiable? Clients that seek out my services tend to be looking not only for a caring and emotionally open counselor, but a skilled and exacting practitioner, 
                        who takes justification of truth-claims seriously.


                         

                        <center>❊</center>

                        <br><br>
                        An exhaustive attempt to describe and compare the major therapies readily available in countries such as the United States 
                        and Germany would be the subject of a doctoral dissertation, so I limit myself here to an overview and comparison of two 
                        approaches: Conventional Western talk therapy (of the specifically Psychodynamic sort), and Integrated Attachment Theory—the 
                        latter of which constitutes the basis of the deep work we will be doing together.

                        <br><br>

                        Western psychodynamic psychotherapy traces its lineage to the work of Austrian philosopher and neurologist Sigmund Freud, who 
                        believed that much of human thought, emotion, and behavior is influenced by unconscious processes. His research and writing 
                        fundamentally challenged the European Enlightenment-era (Cartesian, Kantian) view of humans as fully rational beings. A clinician 
                        as well as a philosopher, Freud enumerated an elaborate theory of the psyche (introducing such terms as Id, Ego, and Superego) <fill>

                        <br><br>

                        Currently, Psychodynamics has moved well beyond Freud, who died in Britain in 1939. However, the practice of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy 
                        continues to take as the answer to the questions, 'well, how do we know that this principle holds?', or, 'how do we know that this process 
                        works?', as fundamentally uninteresting: the appeal is to the authority of the thinker, such as Freud, or Swiss and French psychiatrists 
                        respectively, Carl Jung, or Jacques Lacan—or to the government, i.e., the university that taught the course, or to the institutional body 
                        that granted the license to practice.

                        <br><br>

                        To be clear, I am not making the argument that Psychodynamic Psychotherapy is wrong. It is entirely possible that a practice without a 
                        rigorous relationship to truth-claims can still have something useful to offer. It is abundantly clear to me, for instance, that 
                        adherents to religious programs, or to 'alternative' methods gain some value from them. I am, however, suggesting that my coaching and 
                        counselling practice is different from all of the above in that it insists on a critical relationship to etiology and foundational truth. 
                        This makes my science-based coaching and counselling approach more suitable to those who, perhaps, are not as good a fit for traditional 
                        religions, or who have tried conventional psychotherapy but find it's not as results-oriented as they would like—and, ultimately, who may 
                        care more about knowing that what they're being taught in session is the product of peer-review in an academic journal.
