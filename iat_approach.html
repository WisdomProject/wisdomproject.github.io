                    <p> <b>With a subject as complex and consequential as life guidance,</b> 
                        it is no surprise that there are almost as many views on what the correct approach is as there are those offering to 
                        provide them—and that those viewpoints are debated furiously. My work is differs from conventional coaching, 
                        psychodynamic psychotherapy, or counselling, and is characterized by three pillars:
                    <ul>
                        <li>(i) Scientific, peer-reviewed findings about psychosocial root cause,</li>
                        <li>(ii) An emphasis on the importance of potentially uncomfortable self-exploration, and</li>
                        <li>(iii) Actionable steps, designed to be taken outside of sessions, aimed at
                            <i>subconscious</i> growth and transformation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        All three pillars exist in the context of the emotional openness, care, humor, and responsibility 
                        I hope to bring to my client relationships as a counsellor.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, I practice a model of coaching and counselling that work in
                        concert. Borrowing
                        from the popular adage,
                        <i>"give a person a fish, and you feed them for a day; but teach a person to fish, and you feed
                        them
                        for a lifetime,"</i><br>
                        <!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->I view 'counselling' as the process of giving the client fish, and 'coaching' 
                         as teaching them to fish for themselves. I am a counsellor inasmuch as I invite you to come to sessions as you are, and to view our 
                         sessions as compassionate, non-judgmental spaces where we work together through anything and everything that you choose to bring. I 
                         am a coach, in that my primary goal is to design a program that helps you move towards your goals, and feel fulfilled on a 
                         fundamental, emotional level—by giving you exercises to complete in your own time, outside of sessions. Crucially, this means that 
                         our work together is a joint venture. It is my role and responsibility to lead you through the process, and provide the tools and 
                         psychoeducation you need to keep experiencing breakthroughs. It is incumbent upon you, however, to apply those tools in your 
                         day-to-day life, and to do the work necessary to see growth happen at the subconscious level of mind. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike in conventional psychotherapy, executive coaching, or life coaching, my approach allows you to do as much or as little work outside of sessions as you choose; knowing that the speed at which you experience changes and progress towards your goals is largely within your control. 

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <b>A key concept that we will be leveraging in our work together is 're-parenting';</b> i.e., learning to use one's rational, conscious faculties—which are within direct control—to ‘reprogram’ the subconscious (pre-rational) mind towards capacity, judiciousness, and health. As the conscious mind can only out-will or overpower the subconscious for very short bursts of time, this reprogramming—alongside the rigorous empirical grounding of all that I teach, and my emphasis on the importance of conscious self-knowledge—is perhaps most defining of the work we will be doing together.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        In order to do the work of self-exploration and re-parenting, I employ frameworks drawn from empirical study (such as Integrated Attachment Theory, CBT, DBT, IFS, and the work of the Gottman Institute), and insights on how our minds operate, taken from the latest research in cognitive neuroscience and trauma-informed psychotherapeutic methods. I am agnostic as to the ideological or cultural source of the teaching and wisdom I espouse, so long as the concept can be demonstrated empirically as statistically significant, or by a process of logical proof. In this regard—and without meaning to demean or detract from the potential insights enabled by other methods—my approach differs most obviously from the guidance one might receive from theological sources, executive coaches, life coaches, 'new age' alternatives, or, indeed, from conventional Western talk therapists. I insist on falsifiability, and on the ability to describe in detail to my clients <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> a particular process is supposed to work.


                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <b>A second critical concept in my practice is that of <i>root cause.</i></b> To describe, by analogy, the importance of this idea, I borrow from auto mechanics:
                        <!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->Imagine a car rolls into a mechanic's shop, and the driver reports that the vehicle vibrates dangerously at highway speeds. A passable mechanic might conduct a diagnostic, and draw a conclusion that points to a superficial fix to a superficial problem: The tires are unevenly worn and need to be replaced. This solution might work temporarily, but unless the problem at the very lowest level of causality is addressed, the owner will need to return to the shop eventually, with his car in a similar state. 
                        <!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->Eventually, the tires do wear down again. However, the owner takes it to a different mechanic this time: One who insists on targeting root cause. This second mechanic conducts a much more thorough diagnostic, and discovers a latent issue in the electronics that govern suspension hardness. The on-board computer is failing to synchronize the suspension settings across all the tires, causing uneven wear. Using her extensive training and knowledge about how vehicles work, our second mechanic is able to isolate with as high a degree of accuracy as possible that the root cause—an electronic problem—is causing the suspension to behave abnormally, which in turn creates uneven wear on the tires, resulting in vibrations at high speeds. Knowing the nature of the issue that exists at the lowest possible level inside-and-out, she’s able to conduct whatever fixes are necessary to get the car running again—this time, permanently. And, because she’s fixed this problem many times before, she’s able to use her experience with this type of issue to do the job efficiently.
                        <!-- TODO(Ross): insert tab space here -->The dynamic with our first mechanic is how I would describe my experience with conventional Western psychotherapy. Often, conventional psychotherapy can feel like an endless process of returning to the therapist, who offers temporary relief, in a warm and accepting atmosphere. But it sometimes can feel that the goal and the process is unclear. This is because, in many therapeutic relationships, there is little work being done on root cause. Without a deep understanding of what a problem is, inside-and-out, it is impossible to overcome it. 
                        



                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A truly skilled mechanic, however, who has extensive training and knowledge about how vehicles work, would be able to isolate with as high a degree of accuracy as possible what the root cause of the problem is. Knowing the nature of the problem that exists at the lowest possible level inside-and-out, they'd be able to conduct whatever fixes were necessary to get the car running again. And, because they'd fixed this problem many times before, they'd be able to use their experience with this type of issue to do the job efficiently.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I entered this field because I discovered that—unlike good auto mechanics—most psychotherapists, coaches, counsellors, theologians and personal growth gurus do not hold themselves to the standard of understanding root cause at its lowest possible level. Western psychodynamics, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis—not to mention various forms of new-age healing, or life coaching—rely on tools that might do more good than harm, but often do not get to the heart of the matter. I insist on an academic's approach to the acceptance or rejection of a theory: Is it explanatory? Does it have robust predictive power? Is it parsimonious? And, is it falsifiable? Clients that seek my services tend to be looking not only for a caring and emotionally open counsellor, but also a skilled psychologist, open-minded scientist, and an exacting thinker, who takes justification of truth-claims seriously. My approach is unique in that it is oriented towards results, and offers clear pathways to get there.
