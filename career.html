                    <p style="font-size: 18pt;">Those of us with smartphones, health insurance plans, and potable, running water lead lives of such material abundance as to be beyond the 
                        wildest dreams of the nobility of earlier eras.
                        But, do we truly savor these fruits of our progress? If we cannot
                        enjoy what we already have, what makes us think that more will bring us the contentment we seek? Our goal together is to create the conditions for abundance in your 
                        financesâ€”both in your bank account, and in your mind.
                       <br><br> In addition, despite the material wealth our institutional and economic sciences have produced, it can seem that true fulfillment in a 
                        job seems no easier to find. However, building a life where we earn heartily while doing something we love is a realistic, and important goal. Together, we will dismantle the internal and external barriers 
                        that stand in the way of the career of your dreams.
