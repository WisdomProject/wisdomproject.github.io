                        the 'problem of plenty' that has plagued humanity for the vast majority of our evolutionary history has largely been solved. 
                       <br><br> However, though we have enough food, water, and shelter to go around—for the most part and for most people—true fulfillment in a 
                        job and career seems as elusive as it always has. But this needn't be the case, and finding it is an eminently solvable problem—if only we are 
                        given the tools, often not taught in school or by our childhood caregivers, to systematically work through the internal and external barriers 
                        that stand in the way of the careers of our dreams.
